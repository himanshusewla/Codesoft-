Excited to share that I've successfully completed three engaging projects during my internship at Codesoft! 🎉 Here's a brief overview:

Password Generator 🛡️

Created a robust password generator using Python.
Implemented user input for specifying password length.
Utilized random characters to generate secure passwords.
Displayed the generated password for user convenience.
Simple Calculator 🧮

Developed a user-friendly calculator application in Python.
Incorporated basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Designed prompts for user input of two numbers and choice of operation.
Executed calculations based on user input and displayed accurate results.
Contact Book 📞📧📌

Built a contact management system in Python to store contact details.
Included functionalities such as adding new contacts with comprehensive details (name, phone number, email, address).
Implemented a feature to view a list of all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.
Enabled search functionality to find contacts by name or phone number.
Provided capability to update existing contact details seamlessly.
Each project allowed me to deepen my Python programming skills and reinforce concepts such as user input handling, data manipulation, and interface design. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on these practical applications, which have enhanced my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.

Looking forward to applying these skills and continuing to grow in the field of software development! 🚀💻
